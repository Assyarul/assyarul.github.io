Welcome to my first blog post on my first website! I am Assyarul, currently a Computer Science undergraduate in the National University of Singapore. The primary goal of this website is to document my learning journey throughout my university years and hopefully the years after that as well. Documentation will help both assess my current knowledge base as well as clear up any holes that I've missed along the way.

Diving deep into the sea of knowledge of Computer Science will be an exciting endeavour for me to take. If you reading this, I hope that the posts I've made will also help you in the process.

The topics I wanna learn both on my own and with the help of the courses in my university is varied. Currently, I've already made two projects, a simple 2D physics engine and implementing a genetic algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem. 

Here's to a fruitful experience!
