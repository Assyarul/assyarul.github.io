Welcome to my first blog post on my first website! I am both excited and frightened about this endeavour that I am embarking.  I am Assyarul, both a denizen and citizen of Singapore, a small country situated in the South East Asia region, at the bottom of the Malay Peninsula. I love to learn about absolutely anything especially in the realms of Mathematics and the Sciences. Currently, I am a first-year undergraduate Computer Science student, studying at The National University of Singapore. 

Why create a blog? I want to share the world what I have learnt while at the same time improve my writing skills. This also acts as a documentation of what I have done, and what I will also be pursuing. Creating this blog already taught me a lot about frontend development and design of a website. Exercising the right side of the brain is important as well folks!

The world of Computer Science is vast, often being tangled up with other disciplines ( I would argue every discipline that ever exists ). I figured writing about my process will benefit myself and perhaps others.

In the initial stage of this journey, the projects I am making will be rudimentary. Through such projects and diving deeper, I hope to learn more about this wonderful world and that you will join in for the ride as well.
